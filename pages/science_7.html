These iterative approaches provide digital holograms of high quality, but are very costly in computation. This thesis aims to implement an IFTA that allows to process the computer generated holograms (CGHs) of arbitrary intensity distributions very rapidly and in real-time speed whenever possible. To achieve the necessary computational speed, the algorithm will be computed on common consumer graphics cards by using either NVIDIA CUDA or OpenCL. Both programming models are intended to provide comparable high computational efficiency without the use of expensive dedicated hardware. A common application for speedily generated holograms is holographic projection. In this publication, a spatial light modulator (SLM) is used to manipulate the plain wavefronts of a laser beam to be able to use the continuous stream of holograms. The used modulator is basically a liquid crystal display that manipulates only the phase of the penetrating light field. Furthermore, this display can be addressed by the same graphics card that is used for the computation. Besides, the best suited settings for IFTA based projections and their influences in the reconstruction quality of the hologram as well as the computational efficiency are discussed. </p> <h3>Video</h3> <p>A short presentation of the real-time capabilities of HOLOEYE PhaseFusion.</p> <iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/57455554?portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe> <p width="640" align="center"><font size="1">Used source material by Warner Bros.
